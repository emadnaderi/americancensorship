		<p>I'm censoring my posts in <strong>protest</strong> of two bills that would censor the web. SOPA and the PROTECT IP act would
			give governments and corporations the power to take down entire websites over infringing posts by users, endangering the internet
			as we know it.
		</p>

		<p>To uncensor this post and ensure that internet censorship never becomes law in America contact Congress now. After you do, 
			youâ€™ll see my uncensored post on the next page. Thanks for doing this.
